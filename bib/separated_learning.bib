abstract="Several supportive methods have been proposed to assist learners by moving their bodies while receiving information by means of visual, auditory, and tactile information presentation. Previous research proposed a learning method called ``separated learning,'' which divides the learning process into two phases: one concentrates on receiving information presentation without moving the body, whereas the other involves moving the body. This study developed a system to provide informative presentations on learning dance steps. The system was evaluated to determine whether it can be applied to learning dance steps and whether the level of difficulty affects separated learning. Experiments showed that there was no significant difference between the effects of learning the dance step without moving the body and the ones of while involving body movement.",
